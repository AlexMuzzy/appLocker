        <h1>Setting up the appLocker</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable permissions to use the app correctly.</li>
            <li>Setup the password for your app.</li>
            <li>Select which apps you want to lock.</li>
            <li>close the app and watch your apps become locked from any threatening intruders!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Enabling the correct permissions</h3>
        <img src="file:///android_asset/usage_access.jpg">
        <p>Firstly, once the app opens for the first time, be sure to enable the prompted permissions to allow you to properly use the app.</p>
        <h3>Setup a password</h3>
        <img src="file:///android_asset/setpassword.jpg">
        <p>Now, you will need to set up a password by first tapping on the menu icon at the top right of the app. Then, select Settings, and tap on Reset password.</p>
        <h3>Selecting which apps to lock</h3>
        <img src="file:///android_asset/selectapps.jpg">
        <p>Finally, select which apps you would like to password lock on your phone.</p>
        <h3>You're all set!</h3>
        <img src="file:///android_asset/locker.jpg">
        <p>Any app you now decide to lock will now force you to authenticate the app!</p>
        <h3>appLocker Sharing</h3>
        <img src="file:///android_asset/shareaction.jpg">
        <p>You can also share the number of apps you have locked and secured, thanks to appLocker! (definitely not trying to advertise my app!)</p>
